I don't like you, T-Series
Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once
Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down, T-Series, I'm here to spill the real tea
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But you India, you lose, so best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you we're gonna be completely fucking done
'Cause we only just begun, I review you, zero, bye bitch, gone
So come on, T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series just wet themselves in their pajama
So who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him? (Ew)
I'm a Blue-Eyes White Dragon while you're just Dark Magician (Oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation
But I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (Ops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it came from a mumble rap community
No Papa, no Papa, yes Papa; Johnny
Now down all of this sugar and let's throw this fuckin' party with some
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their momma
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just wetting their pajama
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
You got a population of 1.32 billion
But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million
Sub-bot!
